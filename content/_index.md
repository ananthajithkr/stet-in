Hello!

I am [Ananthajith](/aboutme/) and this is my [Website](/website/).[^1]

I am working on my [doctoral](/phd/) dissertation at IIT-Bombay, in the Humanities and Social Sciences department. I work with texts, mostly Malayalam literary fiction.

I find [reading](/currentlyreading/) a comforting activity. It does not involve sound, other real people, and traffic. On the other hand, it lets us sit down, and it gives us access to complex people and slow thoughts. [^2]

Here is some [stuff](/projects/) that I built. 

You can find my blog at [colophon](/blog/).[^3] A colophon is a page that contains information about the book it is a part of. It usually lists the kind of paper and ink, the typeface, the font size and leading, design choices, the designer etc. It is a close relative of the copyright page in that it carries information *about* the book. There are also websites which lists a colophon, such as [this](https://books.sayahna.org/sfn-main.html). The Greek root of colophon means 'summit' or 'finishing touch' which contrasts well with the title of the website.

You can mail me (guarantees faster response) at hello at stet dot in. If you do not receive a reply, please check your spam/junk folder too. I am also on [Mastodon](https://sciences.social/@ananthajith)

Here is the [dashboard](/dashboard/)
