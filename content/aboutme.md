# Me

I was born in the late 1990s in Nanminda, a village \~20 kilometers from
Calicut city. After finishing school, I studied at IIT-Madras for five
years, and graduated with a Master's degree in English Studies. I joined
IIT-Bombay immediately after my time in Madras.

My PhD work is on discourses of rice in Malayalam literature, in
creating the 'Malayali' in the Twentieth century.

I have interned/worked with publications, newspapers, college
administration, and online platforms in roles related to
copyediting/proofreading/teaching/copywriting and the like.

I play the tabla (trained in it) and a few other percussion instruments
(self-taught). I also enjoy cooking (mostly the movements involved in
cooking/prepping).

I am also a lover and hater of technology. I think it is fantastic that
we can automate a lot of tasks using computers. I also think it is scary
how computers have come to mean just a flat screen/interface for apps
rather than a tool which you can program to do repetitive tasks. I wish
to become more involved in the latter (make the computer do the work)
and less involved in the former (do the work myself).

I have had quite high-level of interests in the following at different
points of my life: bicycles, surgery, airplanes, painting and sketching,
ships, the military, Carnatic music and consumer-level gadgets. I often
fantasize about diving, both sky- and water- types, kayaking/floating on
water. A lower-level of interest in: typesetting, books (as objects),
web-dev, linux+server administration
