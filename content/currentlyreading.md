## 2025

1.  **In Praise of the Stepmother, Mario Varga Llosa.** Finishing the book, I felt I was walking in the dark and missing my steps. Helen Lane's translation is verbose. Which is a good thing.

2.    **The Yellow Book, Amitava Kumar**. Bought a hard copy, persuaded by the subtitle: 'An observer's notebook.' Kumar has zero qualms about form.

4.  **Box of Matches, Nicholson Baker.** ~~Not as brilliant as
    Mezzanine.~~ A book that makes you wonder how such a thing is
    possible, and, knowing a bit about its making, wonder what sort of
    hard and messy work it took to make the thing this smooth.
5.  **Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, Robert Pirsig.**
    Currently Reading. This is the time I finish the behemoth. Hopefully
    without losing my mind. I realise why I couldn't finish it
    earlier---it is not a book that one finishes, but rather, by tasting
    it now and then, grasps it. UPDATE: Still unfinished, but I've read
    past half of it. UPDATE: Is getting too long, I don't know how to go
    on about this.

   6. **Story of the Eye, Bataille** During the time I
    was reading Zen, I had an intense spiritual experience (unrelated to
    Zen). This led me to exploring relations between the idea of the
    'self' and the world, god and illumination, extremes and erasure,
    paradoxes, contradictions, pain, sex and so on. I think it started
    from some reflections I had written down, which took me to
    phenomenology, Rilke, Jean Luc Nancy, Levinas, and then into
    Bataille and Cioran. This is how I ended up with Story of the Eye. I
    think the experience is ongoing, or the experience has fundamentally
    changed me (may not be a visible change) so that whenever I open a
    book, I am taken back to the original experience.
7.  **Letters to a Young Poet, Rilke and Kappus** My hands are shaking
    and unsteady as I write this. Letters was a work I had read in a
    dark and depressing time in my past, and I am rereading it now,
    seven or so years later. A lot has changed and a lot has happened.
    This work is so dense that it is so difficult to hold it and read it
    with a pencil. It has profundities in every nook and corner, and it
    demands the impossible. It asks of us an unwavering solitude, faith,
    and perseverance, and an openness that scares the bejeezus out of
    me. Like a dent that cannot be cured, this work will never leave me.
8.  **Studies in Pessimism, Arthur Schopenhauer** A few essays from this
    series, on suffering, vanity of existence, and suicide. It makes
    logical sense, his arguments. But one must be very careful of
    accepting those, because the logical end of his arguments is just
    saying bye-bye. So it is nice to keep this in mind while you accept
    more life-affirming ones, such as say, absurdism or existentialism
    or eternal recurrence.
9.  **Death Sentence, Maurice Blanchot** Mindfuckery. If one is going to
    read anything so that they can understand something, they should
    also read Blanchot to understand that sometimes one only experiences
    something than understand it.
10.  **How to Read Heidegger, Simon Critchley** Having read Critchley's
    work on Mystical Anarchism, I think it was a beautiful coincidence
    that the most lucid yet engaging work on Heidegger was by Critchley.
    It is not the easiest work to read, of course, especially the
    chapter on Truth and Art. But it covers all the major early and late
    Heidegger, with about half the book covering Being and Time and the
    latter half covering his take on technology, dwelling, art, and
    language. Highly recommended.
11.  **Deivathinte Vikrithikal (Mischief of God), M Mukundan.** People
    say it is the nair existential angst that pervades Mukundan's works.
    Maybe I am part of that population, although I am not a nair by
    birth. Maybe that is the awareness that I have developed as a
    person. Maybe it is a shame that I have not worked on it. But within
    that realm, this is a heavy book. A heavy book with heavy sentences
    and heavy silences and even heavier people who fly in the sky.
12.  **Aa Nellimaram Pullanu, Rajani Palamparampil.** Published by
    Gooseberry Books, who seems to be doing a good job shaping knowledge
    on dalit women lives. Rajani's writings are far from the polished
    sentences which we are used to reading off pages from the literary
    doyens of Malayalam cultural scene. It is a fairly short read, but
    the door it opens to the life of a dalit woman from Kerala, and the
    view that follows this opening, is incomparable.
