# Mirabai

I feel the pain of separation now more than ever. Mirabai speaks for me

> O friend, I sit alone while the world sleeps.

In the palace that held love's pleasure the abandoned one sits. She who
once threaded a necklace of pearls is now stringing tears.

He has left me. The night passes while I count stars.

When will the Hour arrive?

This sorrow must end. Mira says: Lifter of Mountains, return.

(Bly's translation).
