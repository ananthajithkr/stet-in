# Agamben Reading a Poem

I was reading a book chapter on postcolonial resistances when I came
across a poem by Mehmet Al-Assad, titled \*Asylum\*:

\`\`\` Through the wire

one last time

please observe

I am sewing my lips together

that which you are denying us

we should never have

had to ask for. \`\`\`

Following the poem were two distinct readings of the poem, one by a
scholar of law and the other by a scholar of literature. David Farrier,
the literary scholar, quoted Giorgio Agamben extensively throughout the
chapter. In fact, the first section was almost Farrier paraphrasing
Agamben, including Agamben's own reading of Al-Assad's poem.

## 

After having read through quite a bit of political philosophy and the
like, I was prepared for a dry, lemon-squeezer reading of Al-Assad. It
is not enough to say that Agamben surprised me; Agamben took me by my
heartstrings, shook me upside down and put me back. I could try and
paraphrase Agamben here, but I do not think I will do a good job---I am
not sure even Farrier did a good job translating Agamben's thrust.
Instead, here is an excerpt:

> Just as reading Agamben is to encounter emergent forms of new
> political relations, reading, for Agamben, constitutes an engagement
> with the politics of liberation in literary form. In an essay on 'The
> End of the Poem', he traces a parallel between the exception and
> enjambment as a threshold of indistinction in poetic form. As the
> point at which a line breaks according to metrical rather than
> syntactical sense, enjambment leaves a poem poised (Agamben's term is
> 'abandoned') on the threshold of itself. Ultimately, enjambment, like
> the exception, presupposes a crisis: confronted with the imminent
> coincidence of sound and sense in its final line, the poem enters a
> condition of suspense that resembles the exception: 'At the point in
> which sound is about to be ruined in the abyss of sense, the poem
> looks for shelter in suspending its own end in a declaration, so to
> speak, of the state of emergency'.

I think the last sentence is poetic in itself. "At the point in which
sound is about to be ruined in the abyss of sense, the poem looks for
shelter in suspending its own end in a declaration, so to speak, of the
state of emergency." How often do you come across poetry in scholarly
literature?
