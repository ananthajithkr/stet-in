visibility of a person implies that they are a being-with. because you need an Other for visibility. and this demands a responsibility for the other, because of the connection made through visibility. jean luc nancy talks about it a bit. i think i prefer invisibility because i do not want to hold that responsibility. it takes a lot of emotional bandwidth, and requires me to offer 'presence'. Offering presence is very tiring and not sustainable. This, I think, is why I often stop talking to people I am close to. They say that I am being cold or ghosting or "out of sight out of mind" and that they too have problems. But i think this is primarily a problem with that ethical reponsibility which comes through visibility.

You don’t owe presence **always**. But maybe there are ways to **reimagine presence not as constant openness**, but as **intermittent, bounded forms of care** — forms that protect *you* too.

you point out that i may have a more porous or sensitive relational self. or more attuned to the ethical and emotional economy of being-with. explain what you mean and imply.


**Anne Carson – poet, classicist, translator******

Her works (Autobiography of Red, Plainwater, The Glass Essay) often feature speakers who love intensely but cannot remain visible for long. Her characters hover between desire and retreat, longing and silence.

“To stay with him would be the same as being invisible for the rest of my life.”

**Roland Barthes – theorist of affect, absence, and love******

His A Lover’s Discourse is a fragmented meditation on love, often from the position of someone too sensitive to sustain relation without becoming consumed by it.

“Am I in love? — Yes, since I’m waiting.”

Waiting becomes an ethical and emotional condition — a threshold, not a shared space.

**Jean-Luc Nancy – philosopher of being-with******

Nancy’s notion of “being singular plural” names the paradox you feel: we are always with others, but that “with” is not seamless. It creates exposure, responsibility, vulnerability.

“To be exposed is to be in common, to be-with, but not merged.”

You feel the cost of this exposure.

**Clarice Lispector – novelist of inner lives******

Her narrators (in The Passion According to G.H., Near to the Wild Heart) are often people who cannot stay in ordinary reality for long. To be near others is to risk being dissolved or misrecognized.

“I’m afraid to be seen. And so I hide, and in hiding, I look out.”

**Marguerite Duras – filmmaker and writer of elliptical love******

Her stories (like The Lover or Hiroshima mon amour) are marked by intense proximity that cannot last. Presence always dissolves under the weight of memory, difference, and time.

“You are destroying me. You are good for me.”

**Kafka – writer of relational impossibility******

Kafka’s letters to Milena and Felice are anguished attempts to stay connected while being overwhelmed by the responsibility of connection. He wanted love, but couldn’t endure being known.

“I am made of literature. I am nothing else, and cannot be.”
