# Do Not Forget Anything; poem, Kalpatta Narayanan Mash

Unauthorised translation, as always. From *Mathrubhumi*. April, 2024.

Is it a big deal to forget\
a cake of washing soap\
a matchbox\
or a bit of cumin?\
Can't I get them tomorrow?\
I'll go back and buy them\
if you must have them\
right now.\
What is without solution?\
(Except for your quarrels?)\
She, however, hasn't had enough.\
Thought it was just a pinch of cumin that you forgot?\
Was I with you at least\
when I was not there?\
Have you ever come home\
without forgetting\
at least one of the things I asked you for?\
Even as you remembered everything else\
you forgot one thing.\
A thing I needed the most.\
You had forgotten me.\
A four-year old girl\
stood alone\
in the open road from high-noon\
to dark\
five long hours\
waiting for the father\
who told her he'll be back in a minute.\
I would have waited there, even now,\
if not for the neighbor\
who took my hand, saying\
I will get you home\
your father is lost in a game of cards.\
Why do all of you\
do this\
to me?\
