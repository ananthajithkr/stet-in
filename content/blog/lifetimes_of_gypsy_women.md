# lifetimes of gypsy women

From Yama Gilgamesh's book *pen-jypsikalude jeevithakalam* (The
lifetimes of Women-Gypsies, 2023). Translated without permission and
with considerable leeway for picking the words.

Yama is a writer, theater artist, and an actress. Contrary to popular
usage, *yama* is also defined simply as something that has a double.

The extract refers to an incident from the time she was in drama-school.
I could relate to it at first perhaps because of the lightness with
which cis-het men talk about, and act upon, other genders. Later, many
months after I first read the book, I went back to it because the
section I've translated below had seared itself to my mind---all the
violence and grime and shame. It reminded me of my own guilt, shame, and
moral fragility, and the responsibility to deal with it.

> Days and nights are merely ways for the universe to trick us. They
> whoosh past us without yielding to any meanings that we want to assign
> to them, and without a care. One evening, a senior student invited me
> to getting booze from a store outside the campus. I wondered why he
> asked me this, all of a sudden. Even though I did not like him and did
> not trust him, I went with him on his scooter. I figured he must have
> thought that I, as someone who always roamed around in the campus,
> must be freely available. I wondered how I could even think so. The
> pretension which filled his voice made it even thinner. "Some random
> guy", I thought. I tried telling myself that I am ready to welcome
> whatever comes my way, like a woman without a future. I am sure
> whatever he said fell on deaf ears. I drank with him in his room after
> we got the alcohol. I ate. Someone knocked on the door and tried to
> get me back to my place. The guy who knocked told me he wants to make
> sure I was safe. I don't know why, but I acted as if I did not see his
> goodwill and love. I laughed. I drew stars on his wrists without any
> paint. He went back, gloomy.

> I went back to drinking and slept off. I could feel, in my sleep, the
> guy who brought me booze touching me and mating with me. He started
> talking to me when I was half-awake. He told me that he broke up with
> his girlfriend recently because she was a 'slut'. I wondered why he
> told me that. I did not ask him anything. I felt sobered down. Sitting
> in that dimly lit room and thinking about the high ideals he preached
> in his plays, I could feel my hatred boiling. In the darkness, I felt
> that his face looked abominable and ugly. I was shocked by what this
> man had just told me---a guy who talked about proletariat revolution
> and liberation of women. I shouted at him on my way out. I had learnt
> the language of abuse from my stay in the campus. Whatever language I
> already knew was not enough to fight my male antagonists.

> I walked through the darkened atmosphere of the campus, very much like
> a vampire on her way back after sucking out the blood of a man.
