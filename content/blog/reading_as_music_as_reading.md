# ...Reading AS Music AS Reading...

Ananthu, have you noticed that when you read, you move your clenched
fist in the air like someone who is properly listening to music? It
feels as if you are capable of tracing the changes in pitch of the text.
Almost like a musician.

You also move your head as your scan the lines left to right. This
makes, along with the clenched fist, a complete listener to music; your
reading is like a musician retracing the author.
