# one poem

there are gaps in the sidewalk every few meters\
where each block of concrete ends\
like the markings on a clock, appearing after every few strides you
take.\
there are cracks too, not like clock-face-markings\
but random, sometimes covering the width of the pavement\
sometimes just a bolt of lightning spreading from the bottom right
corner to the upper left\
sometimes filled with yellow leaves\
like the sidewalk was a piece of kintsugi\
but it reminds me of something else.\
when i first pulled a's panties down\
i found silver marks on her thighs\
silver on brown\
and i called them tiger stripes\
lightning bolts\
and i would caress them and kiss them because they were beautiful,
jagged and zig-zagging through her brownness.\
today as i walk to air my head out\
i watch the sidewalk, my head down\
and it reminds me of that day.\
