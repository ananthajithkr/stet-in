# in the restaurant

the restaurant is full\
of people who are right\
always right about all things\
always right, never wrong, always their head kept upright\
never one step out of the line\
following it like the line a hen keeps\
when pecking at the grains someone else has laid out for them\
never leading to the gate of the coop\
but only to the butcher's flat, broad, shiny blade.\

In that line of obedient chicken,\
there's just me\
a cock\
just out of the line\
just beyond everything right// always bound to die\
in the narrow gap of the blade.\
