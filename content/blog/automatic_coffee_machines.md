# Automatic Coffee Machines

The automatic coffee machine dispenses\
a predetermined shot of water\
each time you push the button.\
You think about it when\
the coffee shows its true colors\
dark brown and pale white splitting\
three-quarters into the cup.\
The first surreptitious sip was furtive\
because you did not want\
the man who made it\
to feel judged as he was wiping the steaming wand.\
You sit wondering\
how an automated espresso machine\
could dispense an incorrect volume of water\
and cocoon your attention\
towards the cup.\
While there are black ceilings, copper-colored lampshades, an air
curtain affixed to a wooden plank, smoothly shaved legs and scrubbed
feet, the silhouette of a white vest beneath a thin blue shirt, and the
sauce from the mushroom filling vying for your attention.
