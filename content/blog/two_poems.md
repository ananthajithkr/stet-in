# two poems

someone painted over a dead fly on the terrace.\
they would not even brush it away\
they just brushed over it.\
i wonder whether its obituary was lengthy\
with a list of the women in its life\
a mention of its parents\
and its sons and daughters.\
or whether it simply mentioned the name, age, and place of death.\
a lonely death.\
later, sitting outside in the garden in the evening\
a swarm of mosquitoes circled my leg\
i would bring my hand down on my thigh\
and there would be dead mosquitoes.\
i brushed them off, and i did not think of their obituaries.\
short obituaries are sad poems\
name\
age\
and the word 'died'.\
She bought me a packet of mint cigarettes\
She smoked stylishly\
And when I told her this observation\
She tried smoking even more stylishly\
After a while I spied on her\
And saw her blow the smoke out\
Like the smoke was escaping her mouth on its own will.\
Unstylish.\
