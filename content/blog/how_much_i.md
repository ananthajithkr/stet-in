# how much i

mother, do you know how i crumble into dust and waft into the wind
everyday?\
do you know how the long lines of red at the signal outside this place
makes me want to kill myself?\
do you know how much i long to be home?\
how much my place calls me?\
how much i wish i died the last time i overdosed?\
how much i wish to be back to that place of innocence?\
