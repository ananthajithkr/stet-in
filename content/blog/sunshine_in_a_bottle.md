# Sunshine in a Bottle

She shows me an orange vial with a white cap.

A familiar object. It says Fluoxetine on the label.

She shows me her cheek when she leaves and I plant a kiss.

On the way back I feel my lips and find her lip balm (I'd tried it on
earlier).

Back in my room I google Fluoxetine vs Sertraline to see how her sadness
differs from mine.

To see whether I could understand it, if at all.
