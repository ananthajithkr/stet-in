# God, Erection, and Illumination

From Bataille's Story of the Eye

> And it struck me that death was the sole outcome of my erection, and
> if Simone and I were killed, then the universe of our unbearable
> personal vision was certain to be replaced by the pure stars, fully
> unrelated to any external gazes and realizing in a cold state, without
> human delays or detours, something that strikes me as the goal of my
> sexual licentiousness: a geometric incandescence (among other things,
> the coinciding point of life and death, being and nothingness),
> perfectly fulgurating.

Some commentary:

Let us begin with a contradiction: self-erasure is self-fulfillment.
Bataille knew this because he believed that truth has only one face,
that of a violent contradiction. One moment of self-erasure that is
possible in life is that of the orgasm. In orgasm, you are destroyed
(the little death) and simultaneously fully realized. Another moment of
self-erasure is death itself. So it is not difficult to see why death is
the only outcome of erection. The little death, in this specific case,
and Death in the general. So, "if Simone and I were killed" is the
general case, while his erection is a specific case.

Another of this case is that of illumination, or meeting god in
immanence. This is widely acknowledged by religions/belief systems such
as the Christian Gnosticism, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sufism and so on. So,
the outcome of erection, of death, of orgasm is god-knowledge. This
transcends object-subject divisions, which is why Bataille says there is
no need for external gazes, no human delays or detours. This
illumination, in Bataille's words, is a perfect fulguration. And a
geometric incandescence, because in geometry there is absolute clarity,
the kind which you will only find in God, or orgasm, or death.

This is why Story of the Eye becomes a sort of a Bible for the
spiritually oriented.
