# Pigeon Waterfall

From the bridge, a flock of pigeons.\
Like a pailful of water thrown, they descend onto the road below.\
Together, and one after the other.\
Like a mass of water, and like a smattering of droplets.\
They scatter and spread across the ground.\
A group of birds against, and with, gravity.\
They gush through the opened gates of a dam\
which\
unknown to all of us\
was steadily building a catchment of pigeons in this desolate heat.
