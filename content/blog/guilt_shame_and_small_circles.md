# guilt, shame, and small circles

the housekeeper asks me whether i want packets.\
what packets, i ask.\
condoms, he says, in a low voice.\
The next morning i wake up with a bad hangover\
and after the memories come back\
i reach for the collection of bukowski's poems\
to check whether we had met somewhere\
because bukowski had all these things in him:\
women, alcohol, and mercy\
and a man riddled with a history of guilt, shame, and death.\
bukowski, of course, is no help\
because he told me not to try.\
but all i do is try\
and fail.\
i raced everyone, broke rules, and pushed people aside\
only to reach where i began.\
