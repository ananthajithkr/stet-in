# Where do Dogs Begin?

I am sat in the coffee shop in campus after a month of absence. The very
ill, malnourished dog whom I used to feed and pet remembered me and came
to say hi. I was petting him when this man in green polo and specs with
a prominent belly, probably a professor, came to me and told me that he
has been seeing this "dog-petting" for a long time now and wanted me to
go out and pet the dog outside the premises; I was sitting at the
terraced bit outside the shop.

The dog of course did not understood any of this and kept poking his
nose onto my arm for pets. I couldn't do anything, so I just ignored the
dog and sank back, quietly, into *Crying in H Mart*.

I was taught Basheer's *Bhoomiyude Avakashikal* (Those to whom the Earth
Belongs) when I was 15, and I had wept reading Vijayan's description of
bugs and vermin crawling in the grounds of his character's place. I
wonder whether this person who stopped me from petting a dog has ever
helped a stranger pick up tomatoes which fell down from the split bag.
