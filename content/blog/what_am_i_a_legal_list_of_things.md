# What am I? A legal list of things.

I read the Paris Interview\
I drink beer\
I write my thesis\
I type stuff from a bar\
I also take a lot of time to cum\
I think it would be a status symbol to meet a girl with whom I can
discuss jhumpa lahiri\
I wish I was in better shape\
I wish I could be more proactive and bottom with a guy\
I wish I could color my hair blue a day and pink the next day\
I wish I could pay with my AmEx card at a fancy restaurant and at a
haute coutre store\
I wish I owned a car\
I wish I could sit at a table reserved for me and write stuff in a
moleskine or equivalent notebook\
Failing this, I wish I could sit a table reserved for me and write stuff
into my latest MacBook\
I wish I could switch off my phone for a long period at a time\
I wish I be spared of the death of my loved ones\
I wish my bowel movements are smooth\
I wish all judgemental stares at me, or the eyes or those who stare,
explode and char down\
I wish I could have an affair with a woman fourty years old\
I wish I got all the words right\
I wish I could speak with the correct amount of pauses, of words, of
shrugs\
I wish my phone would always stay the latest, and without a case\
I wish I could eradicate poverty\
I wish that people would be attracted to me with zero effort on my part\
I wish that I could have a personal hair stylist\
I wish I could experience hallucinogenic stuff\
I wish I could have a stronger constitution, bodily\
I wish I was not autistic\
I wish I was more empathetic\
I wish I could read situations better\
I wish my 'what am i' lists did not turn into 'what i wish to be' lists.
