# Thoughts on the small alaap in Poove Sempoove, anupallavi

Feels like dropping a nice pathiri on a clean clothesline.

Supple, like a leaf falling from great heights. Measured, like the lone
feather which detaches from the bird.

In terms of touch, it would be like how your hair stands on end when
there is static electricity nearby. The bare minimum contact that can be
called a touch. Just enough.
