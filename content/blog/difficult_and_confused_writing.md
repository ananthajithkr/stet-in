# Difficult and confused writing

Alan D. Sokal quotes Noam Chomsky in his sequel to the infamous
\*Transgressing the Boundaries: Toward a Transformative Hermeneutics of
Quantum Gravity,\* titled \*Transgressing the Boundaries: An
Afterword.\* Available

> "George Orwell once remarked that political thought, especially on the

Comme ci Comme ça, anyone? Or is it écriture féminine or la petite mort?

Also Sokal, same essay

> As an example of "confused thinking'', I would like to consider a

Yes, \*that\* Harding.

> Harding, Sandra. 1991. \*Whose Science? Whose Knowledge? Thinking from

Also, Alan Ryan (1992): "The mood in academic life is sour."

And

> It is, for instance, pretty suicidal for embattled minorities to

> unjustly distributed, that its holders wanted this overlooked and
> purchased all sorts of intellectual disguises for the purpose, that it

> but that that was what had to be done. Once you read Foucault as
