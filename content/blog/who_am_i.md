# Self-acceptance and the issue of knowing oneself

Let us go logically, slowly.

Self-acceptance can be considered a decent goal in life.

To accept oneself, one must know what one is. And how do we do that? We
start by examining ourselves. We find out we are many things, some
reducible to body, some irreducible, such as the mind. So we are an
irreducible thing overall. Which means we can think of ourselves as a
huge never-ending list. We are this, this, and this...and so on. Another
name of this situation is called possibility. We are, thus, sites of
possibility. You can be a scientist today, and a rapist tomorrow. (Some
are both at the same time haha)

So, we have arrived at what we are: sites of possibilities.

I will take a moment to take my hat off to Walt Whitman (contain
multitudes), tat-twam-asi (you are that), Ibn Arabi (Wujud) and the
like.

We are clearly in the realm of mysticism now. Goodbye metaphysics.

Stay calm, do not panic.

Now, the goal itself. Self acceptance.

Accepting that we are sites of possibilities can be difficult for some
people. For instance, me. I am told by my therapist that I do not accept
myself.

This is where I got stuck.
