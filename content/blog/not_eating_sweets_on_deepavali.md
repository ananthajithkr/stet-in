# Not Eating Sweets on Deepavali

I was talking to my mother over the phone, as usual, sometime in the
morning. One of my usual calls. This was the day after Deepavali. She
asked me whether I had sweets, and I said no. A friend of mine did give
me some sweets, but that was not the same as the kind of sweets, or the
concept of them, as we were used to at home. So I told her that I hadn't
had sweets. She probably got a little sad, that her son had not had
Diwali sweets while they themselves had some. She asked me why I didn't
buy some for myself.

Then she told me about the kind of sweets which had appeared in the
market. And she told me that back then, when she was a child, there were
not these many varieties. And that her family wouldn't buy them either.
And that one time when she cried for them, they got her a packet of
sweets, which were the the normal kind, just a few laddus and jalebis in
a packet.

The story isn't that saddening, right?

She told me that one Diwali day, her father (my grandfather) reached
home with a parcel in his hand, and she thought it was a pack of Diwali
sweets. I could imagine how hopeful and happy she must have been. But it
turned out to be a pair of slippers her mother (my grandmother) had sent
off for repair.

This is really difficult to write about. I am probably going to need
more than a therapy session to process this.
