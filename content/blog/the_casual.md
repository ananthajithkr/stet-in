# The Casual

The problem with casual relationships is a language-problem.

We tend to assume, even before any reflection is possible, that casual
relationships are defined in opposition to serious relationships. This,
as you can understand for yourself, is a misunderstanding.

Let us consider how we process the word 'casual'.

Casual relationships, if you want an oppositional definition, are the
opposite of monogamous, codependent and marital relationships. Casual is
*not* an antonym of serious.

Casual relationships, just like any other kinds of relationships, can be
equally or more serious. It is entirely possible and even advisable to
be serious in all sorts of relations including casual ones. They are,
and should be, serious. The sex, the intimacy, the feeling, the trust,
all of these must be serious. Otherwise it is just a shell of a
relationship.

The mass of earth-dwellers think that 'casual' implies a lack of
seriousness, a lack of trust, of emotional safe haven, of care. This is
an utterly misplaced, if not to say childish and rather unreflective,
idea of the casual. In which language is the word 'casual' antagonistic
to the word 'serious'? The earth-dwellers, in the din that they create
themselves, cannot be bothered to think about such fundamental stuff
such as meaning. But in the expanse of thought afforded by certain
orientations of oneself, the din and clamour disappears and reality is
instead illuminated by the slow and steady glow of recognition.
