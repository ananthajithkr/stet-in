# The State of the World

I imagine the world as the cut side of a huge metal cylinder. The cut
face open to everything, its nerve endings exposed, so that all the
events and emotions are felt at this cut face; all the world just an
effect of this cut. And everything else, the power-tripping, beer
bellied, disgusting bureaucrats, and the loud, large-eyed man with
lecherous male pattern baldness, these are all specks of dust in the
otherwise clean, painfully exposed cut.

Yesterday, I read quite a bit of Jhumpa Lahiri, her interview with the
Paris Review, a short story, a diary entry. I was teetering at the edge
of sleep, covering myself with a grey blanket to escape the wind the fan
beat down on me, and something suggested itself to me. A suggestion of
something beautiful, so beautiful that if I could capture it in a page,
it would open the gates of literary expression to me. But the suggestion
was so fragile, that a moment of wakefulness pried it away from my hands
and returned me to the world with the heavy feeling of loss.
