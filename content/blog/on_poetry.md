# On Poetry

Reading poetry is a skill that does not come to everyone. Poetry is
tougher than a novel, mainly because a novel promises a sense of ending.
And then there are novels which do not end, which means that these
novels are just poetry and should be treated as such. Which just
reaffirms that poetry is a tough nut.

But when you manage to break into it, poetry reveals its beauty. Poems
become transparent---we are able to see what the poet sees, and how he
sees it, or a very close approximation of what/how he must have seen it.

The trick is that poetry can be deceptively complex. They look
complicated, but beneath that they are just saying things which are
usual, like this poem by Hass about the fox.

Because yesterday morning from the steamy window\
we saw a pair of red foxes across the creek\
eating the last windfall apples in the rain---\
they looked up at us with their green eyes\
long enough to symbolize the wakefulness of living things\
and then went back to eating---\
