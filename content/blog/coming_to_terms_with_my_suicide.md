# Coming to Terms With My Suicide

> Intense nausea is weariness with body-being; one truly does not
> recognize one's self and its affectednesses. In such moments there is
> only the tiring, sickening sensation; there is no way of making
> meaning out of that experience in a simultaneous moment. This is what
> is meant by the loss of the self. But it was not really a desire to be
> left alone but left untroubled, left without having to respond; in
> short, without having to do anything. Is this surrender of agency
> equal to turning away from all presence and entering a state of
> worldlessness? This state could be compared to Levinas's Il y a or the
> 'there-is', his term for existence without existents/beings, the
> anonymous, dark, horrifying state of blank, non-intentional awareness.
