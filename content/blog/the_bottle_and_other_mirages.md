# walking the tightrope

i sit at my cubicle, surrounded by books, bags, and a water bottle.\
i spy on the other cubicle across me, a water bottle\
just like mine,\
brushed steel,\
the black underside of the cap sitting like a ring on the top.\
And in the haze of the novel on my desk and the glass separating the
cubicles\
I realize that the other bottle is not another bottle\
but my bottle itself.\
In a dream-like moment that passes, there are no two bottles\
but just one\
talking to itself through the glass, across the glass.\
It reminds me of that time when I stood facing the tall mirror\
and I saw not me but another me which was still just me\
but a little outside me\
like how letters rise up on a wet page\
lift and spread beyond their borders and inktraps.\
Another me which spilled over the inktraps of my body\
a feature, not a bug\
a feature in god's image\
which I cannot question\
for I exist in the narrow equation\
where one compound turns to another\
crossing the Nile on tightrope\
never failing, never falling.
