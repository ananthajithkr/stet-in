**Consider using** [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org) and encourage your peers to use Zotero.

**I use:** [Zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com) to write my thesis. It brings together [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org), [BiBTeX](https://www.bibtex.org) and Zotero and has most things a researcher needs. I also use MSWord for the back-and-forth with my supervisor due to its good 'track changes' feature. Everything else about MSWord is a farcical tragedy. I also use jStor and the like for obtaining research papers.
