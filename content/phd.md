### My latest take on PhD

The deliverable from a PhD in my discipline is a dissertation. You might
also have book-chapters, articles in a journal, essays for the general
reader, or even a book.

All of these have one thing in common: words. No matter how good or bad
your thesis is, everything boils down to how you present it; that is,
how you write.

So, rather than imagining a PhD as a 80-20 split of thinking and
writing, it would be more useful to imagine a 0-100 split of thinking
and writing. But of course, you can't have 0 thinking. What I mean is
that think as much as you need to, but the finished product is not your
thinking but your capturing of it in words.
